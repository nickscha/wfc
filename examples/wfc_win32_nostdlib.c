/* wfc.h - v0.1 - public domain data structures - nickscha 2025

A C89 standard compliant, single header, nostdlib (no C Standard Library) Wave Function Collapse (WFC).

This example demonstrates a win32 program using wfc.h without using and linking to the C standard library.

The resulting executable from the build file has only linking to kernel32 (for VirtualAlloc) and nothing else :)

It also does not uses "windows.h" but defines the windows functions prototypes directly since windows.h is
massivly bloated and reduces the build time significantly.

This example tested with clang and gcc.

Please read build.bat file to see the compiler flags and their description.
